      <h1>Getting Started (But on termux!!!)</h1>
      <p>
      <pre style="font-family: Arial; color: White; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">Follow the steps given below:-
<ol type="1"><li>Download Termux if you haven't already: <a href="market://details?id=com.termux">Playstore</a> or <a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/">GitHub</a><li>Open Termux<li>Execute command <code class="code">pkg update && upgrade -y</code> it is optional but recommended.<li>After that execute command <code class="code">pkg install python -y</code> which installs python which is roughly 100mbs.<li>After the installation of python is done execute command <code class="code">pip install -U discord discord.py</code></ol>
<b>You've now completed the prerequisites!</b>

Now for the scary part - Coding the bot, but not to worry here's the basic template:-

<code class="code">import discord
from discord.ext import commands

intents = discord.Intents.default()
intents.message_content = True

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!", intents=intents)

@bot.event
async def on_message(message):
    if message.author.bot:
        return
    if message.content.lower() == "ping":
        await message.channel.send("pong")
    await bot.process_commands(message)

bot.run("YOUR_TOKEN")</code>

But now, where to put the code???

Eh dont worry, just do <code class="code">nano bot.py</code> to create a file called bot.py (you can change the name) and when it opens in termux just paste the code above. And then do ctrl+x then Y for yes and then press enter, How to press enter on mobile? breh it the button you use to create new line on your soft keyboard which you type with!

Now that's done, but how do I run the code? Simply do <code class="code">python bot.py</code> (or whatever the file name is) 

And that's it, you've a bot running! 

<b>Now for some questions y'all might have</b>

<span class="ques">Q - Can I not edit/make code from a file manager or something?</span>
<span class="ans">A - Yes you can but uh its a long process if you dont have root</span>

<span class="ques">Q - Are there any limitations compared to pc and stuff?</span>
<span class="ans">A - No if you are building a "normal" bot and not something like Google server hacker or whatever or if you're building a really large project with like some other coding language along with python and it requires some specific pkgs, there's a chance those packages are not supported. Though you can do this setup in proot ubuntu environment inside termux which overcomes few of these errors but not all.</span>

<span class="ques">Q - Is it safe?</span>
<span class="ans">A - Yes, unless you use code of others - You can use code made by ai though. Other than that the app termux and everything is safe.</span>
