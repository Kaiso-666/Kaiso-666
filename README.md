# Welcome to My Dev Repo

This repository is a collection of scripts and tools I’ve built mainly for personal use—but they might be useful to you too. It focuses on:

- Python — primarily **Discord self-bots** and bot scripts  
- Lua — **Roblox exploit scripts** and utilities

Explore the code, learn how things work, and feel free to improve on it. Below are some of the standout tools included:
