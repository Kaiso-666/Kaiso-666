Sup, this repostry of mine consists of stuff that is useful to me and could be to you to, it majorly base on python (Discord Self-Bots) and Lua (RBLX Exploit) scripts and nothing much, you can maybe learn stuff by seeing how they are made and stuff well have a great day also below is the list of cool stuff

- sbot.py - Is a normal Selfbot Script which has GC and DM messages dump (excluding media) and anti message snipe (basically send another message and deletes it so that the original one is not viewed upon using snipe command) also has a fun mini game of truth and dare

- bot.py - Is normal disocrd bot code which is basically an AI (Gemini AI) which can talk to people in various mood (changeable by its slash command) and yeah literally a talking AI - Originally Made for Frostware Server (https://discord.gg/getfrost)
